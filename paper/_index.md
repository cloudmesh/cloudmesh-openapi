### VM Cloud providers 
Cloud computing providers offer their customers on-demand self-service computing resources that are rapidly elastic and accessible via broad network access [^NIST SP 800-145]. They accomplish this through the economies of scale achieved by resource pooling (serving multiple customers on the same hardware), and utilizing measured services for fine grained customer billing [^NIST SP 800-145]. Examples of cloud providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle’s OpenStack based providers, and more.  Cloud providers offer these resources in multiple service models including infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service, and, recently, function as a service. [^NIST SP 800-145].  These providers are rapidly offering new platforms and services ranging from bare-metal machines to AI development platforms like Google’s TensorFlow Enterprise platform [^tensorflow enterprise], and AI services such as Amazon’s text-to-speech service [^polly]. 

Customers can take advantage of cloud computing to reduce overhead expenses, increase their speed and scale of service deployment, and reduce development requirements by utilizing providers’ platforms or services. For example, customers’ developing AI systems can utilize clouds to handle big data inputs for which private infrastructure would be too costly or slow to implement. However, having multiple competing cloud providers leads to situations where service availability, performance, and cost may vary greatly. Customer’s must navigate these heterogeneous solutions to meet their business needs while avoiding provider lock-in and managing organizational risk. This may require utilizing multiple cloud providers to meet various objectives.
