* make clean: only delete the artifacts created here, the clean wipes
  currently everything
* when using this in consecutive order, would cms init not wipe out the data
* should we not mount the .cloudmesh and other data dire into the conatiner.
  This way we can use the host system for developments. Maybe we need to
* support both ways

* leverage cmsd
  we have told the class that we have cmsd taht starts up cloudmesh in
  a container. Develop a new directory docker-cmsd and use that
