sudo docker run -dt --network host -p 8080:8080 --name cms-openapi openapi:0.1
sudo docker exec -it cms-openapi /bin/bash
cd /usr/local/code/cloudmesh-openapi/tests/generator-calculator
cms openapi server start ./calculator.yaml
then connect via a web browser or curl
only problem is this wont let mongo do anything because 27017 is already taken on my machine
need to figure out how to get containers to talk to each other
which I thought was easy with --network cmsnet --name cmshost and then just curl cmshost:8080 but apparently that only magically works with mongo or something
another container can resolve the host but it's getting connection refused
would also like to figure out how to hit up the docker directly from my machine
should be a docker inspect | grep IPAddress
