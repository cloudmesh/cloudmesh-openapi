Today's tasks require a plethora of analytics tasks to be conducted to
tackle state-of-the-art computational challenges posed in society
impacting many areas including health care, automotive, banking,
natural language processing, image detection, and many more data analytics
related tasks. Sharing existing analytics functions allows reuse and reduces overall effort. However, integrating deployment frameworks in the age of cloud computing is often out of reach for domain experts. Simple frameworks are needed that allow even non-experts to deploy and host services in the cloud. To avoid vendor lock-in, we require a generalized composable analytics service framework that allows users to integrate their services and those offered in clouds, not only by one, but by many cloud compute and service providers.

We report on work that we conducted to provide a service integration framework for composing generalized analytics frameworks on multi-cloud providers that we call our Generalized AI Service (GAS) Generator. We demonstrate the framework's usability by showcasing useful analytics workflows on various cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google and edge computing IoT devices. The examples are based on Scikit learn to use them also in educational settings that can easily be replicated and expanded upon. Benchmarks are used to compare the different services and showcase general replicability.
