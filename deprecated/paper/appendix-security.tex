  \subsection{Basic Auth
  Example}\label{a.5.-basic-auth-example}

  Basic Auth in cloudmesh openapi can be enabled with the following flag

\begin{verbatim}
--basic_auth=<username>:<password>
\end{verbatim}

  flag. As such, this example will be an extension of a previously
  existing example. To follow with this example, navigate to the
  \verb|cloudmesh-openapi| directory.

  We will use the \verb|server-cpu| example which tells the user the
  CPU of the machine running the API.

  For this example, let's create a user with username \verb|admin| and
  password \verb|secret|.

\begin{verbatim}
cms openapi generate get_processor_name \
  --filename=./tests/server-cpu/cpu.py \
  --basic_auth=admin:secret
\end{verbatim}

  We can start the server as follows:
  
  \verb|cms openapi server start ./tests/server-cpu/cpu.yaml|

  The user will now be required to authenticate as the registered user
  in order to access the API. This can be done by specifying the Basic
  Auth credentials in the header as done
  \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization}{here}.
  Alternatively, the user can login via the
  \href{http://localhost:8080/cloudmesh/u}{swagger UI} when the server
  is started.
